 
<h1> 🛠️ Gas Leak Alarm System</h1>

<h2> 🔸 Description : </h2>

This is a real-time Gas Leak Alarm System designed to detect flammable gases like LPG, propane, butane using the MQ-6 sensor. Once gas levels exceed a certain threshold, the system triggers an audible buzzer and visual LED warning, alerting users of potential danger.

The system is powered by an Arduino Uno and is enclosed in a custom 3D-printed case for aesthetic and functional integration in smart homes or kitchens. It offers a low-cost, DIY safety solution that can prevent accidents and protect property and lives.
<h3>🔑 Key Features : </h3>
- 🔍 Real-time Gas Detection using MQ-6 Sensor (LPG, Butane, Propane)

- 🚨 Alarm Trigger via Buzzer and LED when gas exceeds safe threshold

- 🧠 Microcontroller Controlled with Arduino Uno

- 🖨️ 3D-Printed Case for wall or surface mounting

- 🔧 Adjustable Sensitivity (via potentiometer on MQ-6)

- 💡 Simple & Effective solution for home safety

- 🛠️ Open-source and fully customizable
